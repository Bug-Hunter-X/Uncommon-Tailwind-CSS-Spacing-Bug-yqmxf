# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Spacing Bug

This repository demonstrates a rather uncommon bug encountered while using Tailwind CSS. The bug manifests as unexpected spacing or layout issues, seemingly unrelated to obvious class conflicts.

The problem occurs in `bug.js`, where a seemingly simple div element exhibits abnormal spacing.  The solution, detailed in `bugSolution.js`, involves carefully examining class interactions and potentially adjusting spacing utilities.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run a development server (e.g., using Vite or Webpack).
3. Observe the unusual spacing in the rendered div element.

## Solution

The solution is outlined in `bugSolution.js`. This showcases a common approach to debugging similar issues: systematically reviewing and refining the utility classes until the intended layout is achieved.
