```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Fixed!</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 text-[16px] leading-6">This text now has the correct spacing.  The issue was resolved by explicitly setting font size and leading to avoid any unexpected interactions with default browser styles or other classes.</p>
</div>
